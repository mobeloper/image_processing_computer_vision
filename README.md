# image_processing_computer_vision
Perform image processing tasks using hand gestures.

The development of this system is based on the intention to combine computer vision and image processing techniques. Basically, the system allows to modify images using gesture captured via webcam. This means that computer vision techniques are applied to make the gestures, while image processing techniques are applied to edit the images. However, all the techniques used are implemented thanks to the openCV library.
